You are given a node that is the beginning of a linked list. This list always contains a tail and a loop.

Your objective is to determine the length of the loop.

# Use the `next' attribute to get the following node

node.next

###My Solution

def loop_size(node):
    g=[]
    while node not in g: 
      g.append(node)
      node=node.next
    if node in g:
     return len(g)-g.index(node)
