Write a function that determines whether a string is a valid guess in a Boggle board, as per the rules of Boggle.

A Boggle board is a 2D array of individual characters, e.g.:

[ ["I","L","A","W"],
  ["B","N","G","E"],
  ["I","U","A","O"],
  ["A","S","R","L"] ]

Valid guesses are strings which can be formed by connecting adjacent cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) 

without re-using any previously used cells.

For example, in the above board "BINGO", "LINGO", and "ILNBIA" would all be valid guesses, 

while "BUNGIE", "BINS", and "SINUS" would not.

Your function should take two arguments (a 2D array and a string) 

and return true or false depending on whether the string is found in the array as per Boggle rules.

Test cases will provide various array and string sizes. 

The array will always be a square 2D array of single capitalized characters,

and the string will always be a single capitalized word.

You do not have to check whether the string is a real word or not, only if it's a valid guess.

###My Solution

###I devised a method using the same idea as a depth first search and came up with a backtracking loop 

def find_word(board, word):
    def neighbour(a,b):
     if b=='t': return True
     if abs(a[0]-b[0])<2 and abs(a[1]-b[1])<2: return True
     else: return False
    stack=[]
    def loop(k):
     for i in range(0,len(board)):
      for j in range(0,len(board[0])):
       if board[i][j]==word[k] and neighbour([i,j],stack[-1] if stack!=[] else 't') and [i,j] not in stack:
        stack.append([i,j])
        k+=1
        if len(stack)==len(word):return True
        if loop(k)==True: return True
        k-=1
        stack.remove([i,j])
     return False
    return loop(0)
