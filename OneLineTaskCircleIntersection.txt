One Line Task: Circle Intersection - https://www.codewars.com/kata/one-line-task-circle-intersection/python 


Given two congruent circles a and b of radius r, return the area of their intersection rounded down to the nearest integer.

Code Limit
Javascript: Less than 94 characters.

Python: Less than 128 characters.

Example
For c1 = [0, 0], c2 = [7, 0] and r = 5,

the output should be 14.

##I abused a quirk of python 2.7 - this solution would not work in python 3+.
