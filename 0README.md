# Codewars
Some of my Python solutions to problems from https://www.codewars.com .
All solutions are my own work. All my solutions have passed the rigorous testing of the codewars client and solve a large number of test cases in a row in under 12 seconds. I upload my solutions to problems that are 4kyu difficulty or harder and only when I am happy that my solution is not too long or messy, I have completed more 4kyu problems and harder than are uploaded, some don't make the cut.
