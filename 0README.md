# Codewars
Some of my Python solutions to problems from https://www.codewars.com .
All solutions are my own work. All my solutions have passed the rigorous testing of the codewars client and solve a large number of test cases in a row in under 12 seconds. I upload my solutions to problems when: It's not too similar to an already solved problem, the difficulty is 4kyu or harder and I don't deem it an overrated difficulty.
